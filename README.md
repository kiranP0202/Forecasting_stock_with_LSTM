# Forecasting stock with LSTM

### Aim and motivation
LSTM have truly changed the way sequential data is forecasted. My goal here is to create basic reference for LSTM here.

### What is LSTM ?
Long short-term memory (LSTM) units (or blocks) are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for "remembering" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word "memory" in LSTM.

### This repository provides insights into Following basic operations w.r.t LSTM:
1) Reshaping datasets for efficient modelling
2) Building the LSTM architecture
3) Compiling and fitting the LSTM model
4) Using callbacks like early_stopping and model_checkpoint
5) Preparing datset for prediction
6) Predicting the stock prices
7) Visualizing the results for LSTM
8) Evaluating model
